* ZSH configuration "framework"

This is my zsh configuration. Well, more a framework of it.
It is setting quite a lot of defaults, but at the same time
tries to be as user configurable as makes sense. So most of the
settings should be easy (enough) to adjust.

** The boring stuff, license / copyright

It is hard to say what exact license applies: It consists of a lot of
snippets taken from a lot of places all over the net, many of which I
don't remember anymore. Also, many of which are probably small enough
that no copyright would apply.

Where I still remember where it is from, I tried to mark them as such,
giving credit where its due. If you find something in here thats from
you and want to be mentioned, just mail me.

For stuff that is from me, use the following license terms:

* Usage
** Basics
To correctly use this fileset for zsh, you need to understand the
order in which things are loaded by zsh.

Note: Wherever $ZDOTDIR is unset, $HOME is used instead

- Always
  1. /etc/zsh/zshenv  This is not overridable and not affected by the
                      RCS/GLOBAL_RCS variables explained below!
  2. $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv

- If the shell is a *login* shell, it continues with
  3. /etc/zsh/zprofile
  4. $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile

- If the shell is *interactive*, it continues with
  5. /etc/zsh/zshrc
  6. $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc

- If the shell is a *login* shell, it continues with
  7. /etc/zsh/zlogin
  8. $ZDOTDIR/zlogin


On logout it is easier: If the shell exits (not due to exec'ing another
process, but logout/exit), it reads

1. $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout
2. /etc/zsh/zlogout

There are 2 variables affecting the above ordering.

- RCS :: If this is unset, none of the (remaining) startup files
         are sourced.
- GLOBAL_RCS :: If this is unset, none of the startup files in /etc/zsh
                are sourced.

Note: These variables do NOT affect /etc/zsh/zshenv, which is
      ALWAYS read!
** Howto
For the impatient:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell

#+END_SRC

* Sources
** Prompt
The prompt i use is based on various others.
- The "design" is taken from Phil!'s ZSH prompt, as found on
  http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt/

- The tech using zstyle is inspired by the prompt as used by
  the grml-live system <http://grml.org>, see
  http://git.grml.org/?p=grml-etc-core.git;a=summary for details
  on theirs.
  A good number of their support functions are also taken, though
  they got renamed from grml_* to ganneff_* to have a single namespace
  here. (And to direct flames about the bugs to me... :) )

- The winch function as seen in the prompt theme "bart", delivered
  with zsh

- The is-{alias,builtin,callable,command,function} and zpgrep function
  have been taken from "zoppo", see [[https://github.com/zoppo][zoppo]] for more of it, which is
  licensed "under WTFPL unless otherwise noted".
